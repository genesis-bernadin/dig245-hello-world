    <h1> About Me Questionaire </h1>
    <ol>
      <li> Genesis Bernadin, Class of 2023, and Economics </li>
      <li> I am interested in gaining a new skill and want to know how to code
        in HTML. </li>
      <li> I have no experience in web design but I am intermediate in Python
        and Java. </li>
      <li> By the end of this course, I aspire to build cool and
        creative websites from scratch.
        <li> The learn-computing activies explained  proper naming conventions
        for file names and the fundamentals of the command line. For one,
         my first activity highlighted best practices for naming documents.
         To ensure that files are easily organized and retrivable, you must use
          clear descriptive language, avoid abbreviations, avoid spaces, and
          append version numbers and dates. Likewise, with regards to the
          command line, this activity demonstrated how to use the command line
          for shorcuts to navigate the file system, create new files, and run a
          program or line of code.  For example, "whoami" notifies you of the
          user, while "ls" formats your content into a list. All in all, both
         activies provided a basic introduction to GIT and HTML.  </li>
      <li> Web Based Projects - Inspiration
        <ul>
           <li> <a href = "https://direkris.itch.io/you-are-jeff-bezos"
             target = "_blank"> "You are Jeff Bezos" </a>  is a game simulation
             that allows users to pretend to be Amazon CEO and billionaire,
             Jeff Bezos, and instructs users to allocate his exorbitant wealth
             towards solving the world'sproblems (e.g. spend billions to end US
             homelessness). This projects aligns with my interests because it
             uses creativityand humor to highlight the ills of capitalism in a
             way that is digestible without cheapening the overall
             message. </li>
          <li> <a href =
            "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/21/opinion/privacy-chicken-game.html"
            target = "_blank"> "Privacy Chicken" <a/> is another game simulation
            that highlights the extent to which the average web user shares their
            private information online unbeknownst to them. This project is
            remarkable because it employs an innocuous activity (a game of
            chicken) to engage with social commentary on privacy violations and
            increased surveilance on the internet.  </li>
          <li> <a href = "https://pudding.cool/2021/10/judge-my-music/" target =
            "_blank"> "How bad is your Spotify" </a> is a web project that uses
             over two million indicators of music reviews to assess users' music
             preferences. This project is a perfect example of where interests
             meet ingenuity. I appreciate the way the web designer used a common
             interest to create an interactive webpage and I hope to mirror that
             skill soon. </li>
         </ul>
        <!-- <p> Overall, this asignment wasn't difficult but it was time
        intensive because I had to get acclimated to the style and structure of
        HTML. However, I  am happy that I was able to practice the skills I read
        about in CodeAcademy.  </p> -->
